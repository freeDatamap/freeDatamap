### Mindmapping + Business Intelligence = freeDatamap

What is freeDatamap ?
--------------------------------------

####FreeDatamap’s purpose : representing spatially, business data that have no intrinsic spatial properties.

FreeDatamap provides a unique way to browse any kind of data.

It is a web application that provides the possibility to navigate into structured and unstructured data. With its unique algorithm, freeDatamap is able to create a tree structure from flat data. It gathers in one map all the heterogeneous key information of a company.

FreeDatamap helps turning flat and boring sheets of data into a unique visual compelling dashboard. With freeDatamap you can build, aggregate and index a mindmap of data and place decision makers at the very center of the information.
 
What does freeDatamap ?
--------------------------------------

####FreeDatamap allows visualizing data.

It displays data in a force oriented circular layout with a right panel showing the attributes of the selected node. You can browse a big bunch of data by going through any desired node and discover its underlying data. This makes freeDatamap ideal for exploring large datasets.

The physic engine algorithm makes nodes position themselves according to the 2D space around and according to the dependencies they have with each other. It leads to an optimal layout to see the maximum number of information in one glance.

The graph is interactive and allows users to move nodes as well as navigating through them.

####FreeDatamap does analytics

For each node of the graph, there is a set of properties displayed on the right panel. In the right panel you'll find either raw attributes for this node or aggregated ones (sum, average, whatever) with charts providing a visual representation of the data hidden under this node.

Thanks to a fast and powerful aggregation algorithm, remote relationships can be bridged through a unified view from where you can navigate and drill down from macro data to micro.

A multidimensional aggregation is computed recursively from the deepest parts of the graph to its root.

With freeDatamap, you can aggregate thousands of information and bring this complex topology of data into the hands of the right people in a simplified way that enables them to take the best decision within minutes instead of days without.

Use the power of multidimensional consolidation to allow the easiest interpretation of your business.

FreeDatamap is built to be flexible. It was not designed for a specific kind of data. If you have data with some relationships between them, then freeDatamap is for you !

####FreeDatamap does monitoring

Alerts and progression gauges can be added to any node and displayed at the root level but also for each level of your organization.

Any warning coming from any sub-node will raise a warning icon on each node of its parent's branch. You want to see the completion percentage of an operation? Just look at the gauge and then drill down in the graph to find the red gauge and identify the bottleneck.

####Easy to modify

Take the control of your data: from your map you can edit, move, delete any part of the data structure and re-launch the aggregation process to simulate the impact of the organization change.

The capability of changing the map from within the map can be used to measure the effectiveness of an organizational change. You want to simulate the merging of two parts of the organization and see its impact on your OPEX ? The answer is simple as a click.

FreeDatamap makes the link between flexibility and ease-of-use : not bound to a dataset, but flexible enough to adapt to any kind.

####Another reporting tool

From anywhere in the map you can produce an exhaustive word report, not a pdf, but an editable word which can be the starting raw material of a hand-continued study.

####Intuitive and responsive

FreeDatamap delivers a fast and visually attractive user interface that runs on any support: computers, tablets or phones.

You can run it in SaaS (freeDatamap runs in a web page)

...or download it and install it in a web server. If you use it from its web address (www.freedatamap.com) don't worry about the privacy of your data, because, except during the load of the application, there is no communication with the server, as freeDatamap (in its free instance) is serverless : so everything is executed in you web client and stays in your own web browser (to be sure : start playing with www.freedatamap.com, disable your internet connection and then inject your own data, do what you want and don't forget to save your work as a json file or produce your reports).
